               :name: Overview-WhereDoesUnravelServerReside?

            Unravel Server is positioned in a Hadoop cluster on its own
            Gateway/Edge node to communicate with HDFS and TaskTracker
            nodes, and to enable client access to Unravel Web UI. A
            basic deployment takes two hours or less.

               :name: Overview-WhatDoesaBasicDeploymentProvide?

            Once deployed, Unravel Server begins to collect information
            from relevant services like YARN, Hive, Oozie, Spark,Pig,
            and MapReduce jobs via HDFS, analyze this information, and
            store its analyses in its database. Unravel Web UI displays
            information from the database, as well as real-time event
            streams it receives directly from Unravel Server. The figure
            below illustrates the flow of information from the Hadoop
            cluster, to Unravel Server, to Unravel Web UI.

               :name: Overview-WhatAreAdvancedDeploymentOptions?

            After basic deployment, advanced setup steps are optional,
            but may include:

            -  Deploying Unravel Sensors for Hive and Spark, which can
               push additional metadata to Unravel Server.
            -  In YARN, enabling log aggregation.
            -  In Oozie, pushing information via the Oozie REST API.
