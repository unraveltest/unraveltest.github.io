The **Applications** page is the main interface for locating your
applications and analyzing their performance. Unravel supports both
ad-hoc applications, and repeatedly running workflows or data pipelines.

  - Ad-hoc applications are Hive queries, MapReduce jobs, Spark
    applications, Impala queries, and so on; these are generated by end
    user tools (such as BI tools like Tableau, Microstrategy, etc.) or
    submitted via CLI.
  - Repeatedly running workflows or data pipelines are created using
    `cron` or schedulers like Oozie, AirFlow, or ETL tools like
    Informatica, Pentaho and others. 

Unravel currently supports the the following application frameworks:

  - Cascading/Pig
  - Hive (on Map-Reduce)
  - Kafka
  - Impala
  - Map-Reduce
  - Tez
  - Hive (on Tez)
  - Spark
      - Native 
      - Spark Streaming
      - SparkSQL

(lightbulb) Your application's performance and reliability depends on
several factors such as quality of the code, types of joins used,
configuration settings, data size, scheduler settings, contention with
other applications, etc. It takes significant expertise and effort to
get to the root cause(s) of an application's problems. Unravel's
Intelligence Engine provides insights into your application's run to
help resolve it's problems/inefficiencies. These insights are called
*events*. For more information about events, see the [Event Panel
Examples](#TheApplicationsPage-EventPanel).

The Applications Page has three tabs:

  - Applications,
  - Workflows, and
  - Sessions

**Applications Tab**

By default this tab lists all applications for the past week. However,
this view initially search results are ordered by the most recent start
time. To reorder the results by another property, click the appropriate
header in the results table.

**Finding Applications**

You can search for your application(s) in a variety of ways:

  - The left sidebar allows you to filter you **App Name**,  **App
    type**, **Status**, **Tags** (if any)**,** **Queue**, **User**,
    **Cluster**, **Duration **(Min and Max duration), and **Number of
    Events. **
  - By **time period,** including specifying custom range by dates and
    times, using the date picker or scroll by page (1).

If the job is part of a Hive query, Pig script, or a Workflow, a link to
it is noted in the job's **Go To** column (2). Clicking on the
application (3) takes you to the application's program manager (APM),
i.e., MapReduce, Impala.

**Workflow Tab**

The layout of this window mirrors the **Applications** tab above. When
there are no workflows tagged, the table is empty. You can use the date
picker to select a date and time range. You can search for a workflow by
name, enter the string in the search box; any user or workflow name
matching or containing the string is displayed. Click on the workflow
name to bring it up in the [Workflow Manager Application
Manager.](#TheApplicationsPage-WorkflowAPM)

Click **Add Workflow** for a popup window listing all, if any, untagged
workflows. The number of untagged workflows is noted in the title bar.
Click on the radio button next to the workflow(s) you wish to add. Click
**Add** **Selected Workflows**. Your changes are lost when closing the
window before clicking **Add** **Selected Workflows.**

**Sessions Tab**

Sessions allows you to run your application expressly to tuneits
performance for:

  - efficiency: decrease the application's time (end-to end duration)
    and resources (shortening duration is first priority), or
  - reliability: in attempting to reduce resources Unravelprioritizes
    memory allocation to ensure the application doesn't fail due to "out
    of memory" exceptions.

Why use sessions when Unravel already offers insights and
recommendations on an application's run?

  - You direct the tuning goal.
  - You can provide multiple runs of an application providing a larger
    data pool for Unravel to analyze.
  - You can have Unravel apply the recommendations for you and run the
    newly configured application.
  - You can see the effects, both positive and negative, the tuning has
    on an applications run.
  - You can compare runs configurations.
  - You can repeatedly tune the application until Unravel has no more
    recommendations.
  - Your session is saved and can be run again, e.g., new runs added,
    cluster configuration changed.

You can tune:

  - Spark
  - Hive on MapReduce

Sessions can serve simply as a tool to compare two runs of the same
application.

The Sessions tabs opens displaying all current sessions sorted on
**Sessions Name** in ascending order. The **Start Time** is the time of
the latest application run. **Number of Apps** is the number of runs
inside the Session.  Some of these runs were added when the Session was
created and some were created by Sessions when it applied it
recommendations.

The four (4) KPI's **Duration**, **IO**, **vCore Seconds**, and **Memory
Seconds** are essentially what the fine tuning hopes to minimize. The
column contains a trend line which plots all the apps (vertices)
contained in the Session. Beneath the trend line, the average and the
best value is noted. For example, VCore9, has 3 apps , for **Duration**
the average is 19m 24s and the best time was 38.31% better than this.
You can not draw the conclusion that the same app performed best for
each KPI.  Last the **Cluster ID** is listed. You can sort the table on
Session Name, Start Time and Cluster. Click on the edit button to edit
the session.

You can search for a session by name. Enter the string in the search
box;  any session name matching or containing the string will be
displayed. 

****Creating a Session****

You can uses sessions

  - **manually** - where you actively control the analysis and
    application of recommendations, or
  - **automatically** - where sessions performs the iterations without
    you intervention until it reaches the maximum allowed runs or finds
    no more recommendations

****Manual Session****

Click **Create Session. ** You must name your session, it does not have
to be unique but we recommend you do so. Chose the **Application Type**
and **Tuning Goal** from the pull-down menu and the tuning goal.  Add
the **App IDs **of the application(s) you want to tune you. Click **+Add
another App ID** to add more apps. Click to delete an App ID. Click
**Add** to create the session.

If you are tuning a Spark App you must supply the JAR path and Class
Name.

****Auto Tune Session****

You have the additional option to specify the maximum number of runs. 
If not specified, iterates continues until no recommendations are
available.  When specified, the iteration stops at the maximum number or
lack of recommendations, whichever comes first. 

****Via the Events Panel****

If an applications has [events](#TheApplicationsPage-EventPanel) with
recommendations you can create a session directly from the
recommendations tab. You can create either a manual or auto tune
session. Click the type of session you wish to create and session popup
is filled out except for the session name.

**Session**

The Sessions APM layout is similar to all APMs.  Instead of KPIs
reflecting the Application, Sessions KPI's are trends which graph the 
various runs resource usages measured when tuning, duration, IO, and
resources. The example below is a session view immediately after
creation.

The left tab, **Applications** is the list of runs; initially it is
whatever was loaded when the session was created. As analysis and
application of recommendations occur more runs are added. 

**Right Tabs**

  - **Progress Tab -** Keeps a log of all the activity.  See example
    above.
  - **Trends** - Expanded graphs of Duration, IO, Resources
  - **Compare -** Allows you to compare two of the runs.

See Sessions Use Case for more information on using this feature.

**Typical Application Manager's Layout **

  - A black title bar notes the application type, i.e., Spark, Impala,
    MapReduce, Fragment, etc) and the job ID. On the right side of the
    title bar are glyphs for adding a comment, and to minimize or close
    the tile if possible. If the jobs has a parent, i.e., Hive, Pig,
    there will be a arrow with the parent's type. Clicking on it brings
    up its APM.
  - Unravel's Intelligence Engine can provide insights into an
    application and may provide recommendations, suggestions and
    insights on how to improve the application's run. When there are
    insights a bar appears immediately below the title bar. If Unravel
    has recommendations the insight bar is orange, otherwise it's blue.
    For more information about events, see the [Event Panel
    Examples](#TheApplicationsPage-EventPanel).
  - The next section contains general job information and Key
    Performance Indicators (KPIs) (as applicable)
  - **Event icon**: notes the number of events the job had. **No
    Events**, instead of the box, is noted if there were none. This job
    has 2 events, clicking on the icon brings up a panel which contains
    one or more Tabs, as relevant, i.e., Recommendations, Efficiencies,
    Application Failure. See the [Event Panel
    Examples](#TheApplicationsPage-EventPanel).
  - **Job icon: **notes the job type and status. The box is colored code
    to indicate as the application's status.
  - **Job information:** job number, owner, queue, cluster and
    start/stop time.
  - **KPIs:** these vary by job type.

The last section, typically divided into two, has specific information
related to job. Each Application-Specific Manager Section goes into
detail about this section. If the job is composed of tasks/jobs/stages
they appear on the the left under **Navigation**. Clicking a row brings
up detailed information about it in a tile/panel below. The Auto
Action/Event () column notes the number of events associated with the
job/stage.

  - Common Tabs:
    
      - **Errors:** The Hive, MapReduce and Workflow APMs contain this
        tab. It lists all errors associated with the job. Like job
        status, the errors are color coded and number for each type
        (fatal, errors, warnings) are noted for each job. The top line
        list the number of all jobs/task. The errors are grouped by
        tasks/jobs and then by severity. For each job/task the total and
        type of errors are noted. Time, keywords (if any) and a brief
        message is displayed for the error.
        [Keywords](Some-Keywords-and-Error-Messages_541098674.html)
        extract important details from the errors messages/log data that
        can help developers/operators quickly root cause issue. "No
        errors found" is displayed when there are none.

  -   - **Conf/Configuration**: The MapReduce, Spark and Tez APMs
        contain this tab. It lists the configuration parameters for the
        task/job being displayed and their values. The parameters vary
        according to task/job.

  -   - **Tags**: All APM's except Pig and Cascading contain this tab.
        It lists the defined tag keys and associated values for the
        application. The example below has two tag keys, *project* and
        *dept* with each having one value, *group11* and *hr*
        respectively.

**Application-Specific Managers**

**Cascading and Pig Application Managers**

The only difference between the two Application Managers is the job type
name; otherwise they are exactly the same. The example used below is the
Pig APM.

**Key Performance Indicators**

  - **Events**: The number, if any, of Unravel insights for this query.
    See the [Event Panel Examples](#TheApplicationsPage-EventPanel) for
    more information.
  - **Duration**: Total time taken by the query.
  - **Data I/O**: Total data read and written by the query.
  - **Number of Yarn Apps**: The number of apps that make up the
    workflow.

**Hive Application Manager**

The Hive Application Manager provides a detailed view into the behavior
of Hive queries. Typical users are Hadoop DBAs or application owners
(engineers, BI team, analysts). You can use this view to:

  - Resolve inefficiencies, bottlenecks and reasons for failure within
    applications.

  - **Events**: The number, if any, of Unravel insights for this query.
    See the [Event Panel Examples](#TheApplicationsPage-EventPanel) for
    more information.
  - **Duration**: Total time taken by the application to complete
    execution.
  - **Data I/O**: Total data read and written by the application.
  - **Number of YARN apps**: The number of YARN apps making up the
    query.

**Tabs**

By default the Hive APM opens displaying the **Navigation** and
**Query** tabs.

The left Tabs are:

  - **Navigation**: List all the MapReduce jobs associate with the
    query. Click on the job name to bring up job in the [MapReduce
    Application Manager](#TheApplicationsPage-MapReduceAPM) tile. 

  - **Execution Graph**: Shows detailed information about the MapReduce
    jobs and their relationship with one another.(lightbulb) This view
    helps identify bottlenecks and

    </div>
    
    <div id="expander-content-1565709510" class="container expand-content">
    
    The graph provides a quick and intuitive way to understand the
    MapReduce jobs. Upon opening the tab you immediately see the MR jobs
    (1) in relation to each other along some job info: tables used, the
    job length in absolute and relative value to the whole.
    
    Clicking on the job brings up a box with more Table KPI's, forward
    path(s) for the Map and Reduce operations, and input paths (should
    you want to show them). Click on a table name to bring up the [table
    information](The-Reports-Page_539820049.html#TheReportsPage-TableDetail).

**Unravel Insights for Kafka**

Auto-detection of Lagging/Stalled Consumer Groups 

Unravel determines Consumer status by evaluating the consumer's behavior
over a sliding window. For example, we use average lag trend for 10
intervals (of 5 minutes duration each), covering a 50 minute period.
Consumer Status is evaluated on several factors during the window for
each partition it is consuming.

<div class="container">

For a topic partition Consumer status is 

  - Stalled if:
      - Consumer commit offset for the topic partition is not increasing
        and lag is greater than zero.
  - Lagging if:
      - Consumer lag for the topic partition is increasing consistently,
        and,
      - An increase in lag from the start of the window to the last
        value is greater than lag threshold (e.g., 250).

The information is distilled down into a status for each partition, and
then into a single status for the consumer. A consumer is either in one
of the following states:

  - OK,
  - Warning: the consumer is working, but falling behind, or
  - Error: the consumer has stopped or stalled.

</div>

**MapReduce Application Manager**

The MapReduce Application Manager provides and easy way to understand
the breakdown of the application. You can use this view to:

  - Drill down into MapReduce jobs that make up the application, and
  - Resolve inefficiencies, bottlenecks and reasons for failure within
    applications.

It contains similar sections to the Hive Application Manager and
additionally shows the timeline view of MapReduce job execution, logs
and configuration.

      - **Attempts**: Number of task attempts are charted in
        "wall-clock" time. The aggregated time of all tasks running in
        on the Map/Reduce slot duration is noted below the graph.
      - **Containers, Vcores,** and\*\* Memory\*\*: Graphs utilization
        of slot containers, vcores, and memory over time.

  - **Timeline**: Displays the details of each MapReduce job by showing
    the execution of each task on the machine it was executed

    The Timeline tab is divided into two sections:
    
      - a **Distribution** chart (which displays either the **Map** or
        **Reduce** tasks)
      - a bottom table which lists either the tasks by stages on servers
        or teh list of tasks and their associated KPIs'
    
    The default displays the Map jobs and the timeline. You can change
    the Distribution Charts by selecting **Map** or **Reduce** (1).
    Whether to display the **Timeline** or **Selected** tasks (3). When
    displaying the timeline you can filter the display by Map, Reduce,

**Event Panel Examples**

The Unravel intelligence engine helps you manage your applications more
efficiently by providing insights into their run. The UI engine gives
its insights and tuning suggesting via the Events Panel. Not all UI
engine insights results in concrete recommendations, so to take full
advantage you must read the efficiency panel. There is not a 1-1
correspondence between the event and recommendation number. A single
event might lead to no or many recommendations.

**Recommendations**

Lists the parameters to change, shows their current and recommended
value.

**Efficiency**

The efficiency list details the inefficiencies. The UI engine then

  - might make a recommendation and may note the expected result from
    such a change,
  - make a suggestion, or
  - note where to look to increase efficiency

Below are two examples. Each type of job and instance of a job has
events relevant to that particular job and instance.

**MapReduce Job Example**

This MapReduce job is part of a Hive Query. In this example the UI
engine lists list four (4) events and has three (3) recommendations.

**Recommendations**

**Efficiency 1: Used Too Many Reducers**

Resulted in the one recommendation (\#1).\*\* \*\*

**Efficiency 2: Reduce Tasks that Start before Map Phase Finishes**

Resulted in one suggestion**.**

**Efficiency 3: Too Many Mappers**

Resulted in the two recommendations (\#2 and \#3).

**Efficiency 4: Large Data Shuffle from Map to Reduce**

Resulted in a suggestion.

**Tez DAG Example**

This Tez DAG job is part of a Hive Query. In this example the UI engine
lists list three (3) events and has four (4) recommendations.

**Recommendations**

**Efficiency 1: Tez DAG Map Vertex used too many tasks**

Resulted in two suggestions (\#3 and \#4) and explanation of the
problem.\*\* \*\*

**Efficiency 2: Tez DAG Reducer Vertex used too many tasks**

Resulted in one recommendation (\#1).\*\* \*\*

**Efficiency 3: hive.exec.parallel is set to false**

Resulted in one recommendation (\#2).\*\* \*\*
